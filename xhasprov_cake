== Procedure

=== Part 1: Chocolate-nougat cake

. *Cocoa-nut corpus:*
Grind walnuts (2-3 spoons put aside to pour out the cake form).
Mix the egg yolks with the sugar into the foam. Then mix the ground nuts and sift the cocoa. Whites are whipped from the whites and lightly mixed into pieces. The bottom of the cake mold with a diameter of 27 cm is lined with baking paper, the sides are wiped with butter and spilled with the ground minced nuts. Pour the finished dough into a cake mold and bake at 180 ° C for about 40-50 minutes. After baking, let the corpus cool down and cut in half.

. *Chocolate cream:*
Let the chocolate dissolve in the water bath. Add the sugar and stir until it melts. Wait for the mixture to cool a little and then add the whole eggs (one at room temperature to avoid the cream) one by one using a whisk mixer. Finally, fold the bowl over the water bath and whisk until the cream thickens. Add 3 tablespoons of nut-nougat cream and leave to cool. Then add the softened butter (the cream and butter must be at the same temperature to avoid the cream). Let it solidify in the refrigerator.

. Fry the walnuts in a pan and chop them into small pieces. Spray the bottom of the body with a thin layer of prepared chocolate cream and sprinkle with chopped walnuts. Apply another layer of cream on them using a pastry bag and smooth with a paddle. Put the upper part of the body and cover the whole cake including the sides with a cream (we will keep a little on the second part of the cake). Let the whole cake solidify in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

=== Part 2: Cream-raspberry cake

. *Bright corpus:*
Mix the egg yolks with the sugar into the foam. Add oil while stirring. Finally, mix the flour mixed with the baking powder in portions and finally mix the snow whiskey lightly. Spread the bottom of the cake mold with a diameter of 19 cm and bake the sides with butter and flour. Pour the dough into a mold and bake at 180 ° C for about 35 minutes. After baking, let cool and cut in half.

. *White Cream:*
Whisk the cream for whipping, mascarpone, powdered and vanillin sugar in a bowl at low speed for a smooth, smooth cream. Let him solidify in the refrigerator.
. Apply raspberry jam to both parts of the light body. Apply the cream cream layer to the bottom of the jug and place the raspberries next to each other, add the rest of the cream cream and place the top of the body. Let it solidify in the refrigerator. Then spread the whole cake with the remaining chocolate cream and smooth the paddle. Once again, let it cool properly.

=== Part 3: Put it all together
. *Glaze:*
Put the cream in the pot, sprinkle the broken chocolate and mix until dissolved. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and let it cool a little. Spread glaze  on top of the two cakes on top of the grid and solidify in the refrigerator.

. *Decoration:*
For a larger, chocolate-nougat cake, carefully place a smaller, cream-raspberry cake. Chocolate bars are pinned around the top of the top cake. We will decorate the whole cake with fancy fresh fruit to resemble a waterfall. We can also use colored ribbons for decoration.
